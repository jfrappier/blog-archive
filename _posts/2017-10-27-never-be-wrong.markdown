Before the Boston VMUG User Conference ends for the day, they have an event called After Hours, which includes a talk generally more focused on career/personal matters rather than technology and chance to have a drink with friends.

I was given the opportunity to present during the October 2017 UserCon, my talk - "How I learned to never be wrong, and you can too"

The Boston VMUG crew - Steve, James, and Matt are awesome and managed to rig up the mic's to record my talk. I hope everyone that attended enjoyed the talk. I would love feedback, should I ever have the opportunity to present it again.
