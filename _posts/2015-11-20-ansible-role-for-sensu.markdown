I am looking into various monitoring products, and since I may need to install them again, that means automation. With some help from Sarah Zelechoski and Larry Smith, I have the first pass done on an Ansible role for Sensu. There may be better ones out there, or you <a href="https://sensuapp.org/docs/latest/installation-overview" target="_blank">might just want to follow the directions manually</a> but so far this role gets the install working up through the base install with examples. This is just as much about me getting better with Ansible, don't like how I did something? PRs welcome as that is how I will learn from those with more experience.

The role is still a work in progress, so very much as some clean up to do, but should get you going quickly on Ubuntu 14.04. Here is a screenshot of the sensu server log:
