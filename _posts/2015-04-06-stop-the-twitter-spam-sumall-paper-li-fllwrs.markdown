There are many tools out there that can help you manage your social media presence, unfortunately some of these tools take to the equivalent of spamming your followers with auto posted tweets, probably the most egregious of them is Sumall. You know the "How I did on twitter this week" tweets.

There are others, not to pick soley on small.com, like fllwrs.com, paper.li, and VMware Advocacy tweets to name a few. While they are a nice guideline for you as an individual to see, it really offers no value to your followers. There are a couple of ways to stop this. First is to unauthorize the application from your Twitter settings:
<ul>
	<li>Log into Twitter</li>
	<li>Click on Â your profile picture in the upper right corner and select Settings</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Click on Apps and see a list of all the applications you have given permission to use your Twitter account</li>
	<li>Click the Revoke access button next to the app</li>
</ul>

Now keep in mind, this will block the application from using your Twitter account. As I mentioned before some of these tools can be handy to you personally. The other option is to disable auto tweets directly from the application itself. For example for sumall its:
<ul>
	<li>Log into sumall.com</li>
	<li>Go to Account Settings</li>
	<li>Click on Twitter preferences</li>
	<li>Disable any notification</li>
</ul>
Now, you can continue to use those tools while not spamming your followers. If there are other tools you are using, please share the directions in the comments about how to turn off the auto tweets.
