This year at VMworld I presnted a vBrownBag Tech Talk on using the vSphere 6.5 APIs with Ansibles URI module. I will be expanding on this talk for the Boston VMUG in October during a longer session.

Check out the recording and let me know what you think, what you'd like to hear more of, or any uses cases you can think of in the YouTube comments.
