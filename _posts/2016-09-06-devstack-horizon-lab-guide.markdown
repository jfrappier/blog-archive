Last year I had the opportunity to work on VxRack with Neutrino which is a appliance based OpenStack solution. While it was great to have hardware to play on, I wasn't able to reproduce this setup at home.

To that end, I wanted to be able to practice common tasks in OpenStack, so I created a lab guide based on DevStack. DevStack is easy to install, and the labg guide will walk you through setting it up as well as some common tasks such as creating images, networks, and instances.

You can download the lab guide <a href="http://jfrap.com/images/OpenStackHorizonLabGuideForDevStack.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
